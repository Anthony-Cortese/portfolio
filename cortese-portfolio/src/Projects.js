              IMDb is my favorite website that I use daily, so I decided to
              build it out from scratch which you could call "my version". The
              website has a fully functional navigation bar, each button will
              take you to a new page. The play buttons will bring up a trailer
              on click, and on the IMDbTV page will do the same if you click on
              the movie poster. The website is fully responsive, and with a
              horizontal scroll the images will change-- and a final fun fact on
              the Coming Soon To Theatres section are 3 short films that I have
              personally directed!

                Family Promise is a non-profit organization geared to help
                homeless people get off the street and into self-reliant,
                sustainable situations. One of the ways they accomplish that
                mission is by offering a variety of services. This app was a
                tracker for services offered, and a tool for various positions
                at the organization to see recipients of services, what stage in
                their journey they were on what other services they were
                eligible for and much more.

              This was the first project I personally built out on my own. I
              used two different API's to get the correct information I wanted
              for my movie database. You are able to search for any movie title,
              and you will recieve the release date, rating, and the plot based
              on that movie!
